      <h1>Welcome to Telemetry of RC Car !</h1>
      <p>Transmission of data from a remote object to a ground station is termed as telemetry. The transmitter on the car transmits the desired properties like orientation, velocity, position and battery percentage of the vehicle in real time to the ground station.
        The receiver after receiving the signal forwards the data to several other programs to be processed further. The data finally reaches the web browser where the data is viewed in order to easily track and visualize the condition of our vehicle.</p>
